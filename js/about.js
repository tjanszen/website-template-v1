var learner = "Advantageous about learning something new every single day. Whether it is listing to an iTunes podcast, watching a YouTube clip, reading a book, or reading through blogs - I always search out ways to broaden my perspective.<br><br> One of my favorite quotes reads &ldquo;Life is not about finding yourself, life is about creating yourself&rdquo;. Creating is about searching out experiences to learn and grow."
var programming = "I am autodidact who has the passion and determination to pursue his dream as Full Stack Developer. <br><br>One of my side projects is developing a site to help guide those who are passionate about learning to code. There thousands of resources available online but choosing what to learn can be difficult. Having a plan on how to get somewhere is always a good idea. The site will help guide those interested in taking their coding skills to the next level."
var NCAA = "Growing up I always aspired to swim in college. I walked-on Miami University&#39;s Swim Team. I earned a spot on the team, received an athletic scholarship after my first year performances, and competed four years as a NCAA Division I Athlete.<br><br> Swimming taught me the importance failure. I failed hundreds of times during races, practice, and competition. Life is about picking yourself up and learning from your experiences."
var business = "My business degree is in Marketing. I am a true believer in companies and individuals establishing unique brands. Brands distinguish us from one another and allow us to establish unique identities. Developing a voice and message empower companies and individuals.<br><br> In addition to my studies, working for a startup company was one of the best decisions in my career. Startups force you to think smart, be creative in tough situations, take ownership, and learn to overcome adversity. "
var experience = "I have been fortunate to work with great brands throughout my career.<br><br> My first PM projects were for P&G brands Pringles, Downy, Puffs, and Pantene. While consulting at eyewear giant Luxottica Retail, I was the PM for the Sunglass Hut Australia e-commerce website (desktop and mobile). Recently at LISNR (Cincinnati startup) I was the PM for the Budweiser Made In America mobile app (iOS and Android) and a mobile application for Walmart (iOS and Android)."
